# Hannah's Data Science Exam

The purpose of this ReadMe is to show my output and thinking from each question.

Ideally store a minimum working example data set in data folder.

Add binary files in bin, and closed R functions in code. Human Readable settings files (e.g. csv) should be placed in settings/


```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))


# Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/Users/hanna/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/21082022/",
#                           template_name = "Q1",
#                           build_project = T, open_project = T)
#

# Texevier::create_template_html(directory = "C:/Users/hanna/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/21082022/",
#                           template_name = "Q2",
#                           build_project = T, open_project = T)
```
