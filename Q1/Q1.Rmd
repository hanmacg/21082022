<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
Example_data <- Texevier::Ex_Dat

# Notice that as you are working in a .Rproj file (I am assuming you are) - the relative paths of your directories start at your specified root.
# This means that when working in a .Rproj file, you never need to use getwd() - it is assumed as your base root automatically.
write_rds(Example_data, path = "data/Example_data.rds")

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

Question 1 examines...

> I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code. Also, be mindful of the fact that bib references from google scholar may at times be incorrect. Reference Latex forums for correct bibtex notation.

# Data  {-}

My data looks at ....

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

Figure 1 ....

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

 

```


Figure 2 ...

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

ExampleData <- read_rds( "data/Example_data.rds")

source("code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") # Load a function from your 'code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( "code/Data_Create.R") #

ExampleData <- Data_Create(N = 100) # Same as the ExampleData loaded above - this is just a function to create the stored data.

g <- Example_Plot_Scatter(DataInput = ExampleData,
                          X = "Height_Score",
                          Y = "Weight_Score",
                          Z = "Agility_Score",
                          Theme = theme_bw(), # run ?ggthemes for other themes.
                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above.
                          Ylab = "Height",
                          Xlab = "Lenght",
                          LegendTitle = "Agility",
                          TitleSize = 10,
                          LabSize = 10)

g



```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1}  and \ref{Figure2} are excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

# Results

Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).


```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}


```



```{r LongTable, results = 'asis'}

```

\hfill

<!-- hfill can be used to create a space, like here between text and table. -->


```{r, results = 'asis'}

if(!require(huxtable)) install.packages(huxtable)
library(huxtable)
data(diamonds, package = 'ggplot2')
Title <- "Regression Output"
Label <- "Reg01"
lm1 <- lm(price ~ carat, diamonds)
lm2 <- lm(price ~ depth, diamonds)
lm3 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds)

huxreg(lm1, lm2, lm3,

                note = "%stars%.") %>%
  set_caption(Title) %>%
  set_label(Label)
# More settings:
font_size(htab) <- 12
# Let's change regression names: this is slightly hacky, but works. Comment out this section to see what the default looks like:
  Names <- c( "Reg1", "Reg2", "Reg3")
  for(i in 1:length(Names)) {
    htab[1,][[1+i]] <- Names[i]
  }
# Now simply call the table:
htab

```
