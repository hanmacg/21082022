# Introduction {-}
 I must convince my freind to stay in Cape Town and not move to London.

# Data  {-}


<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r }
# This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

UK <- read_csv("data/UKMonthly_Detailed.csv")
london_weather <- read_csv("data/london_weather.csv")

london_weather$date <- as.character(london_weather$date)

london_weather$date <- as.Date(london_weather$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

UK$DATE <- as.Date(paste0(UK$DATE, "-01"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

# London {-}

Firstly, I examine data on London specifically, as this is likely where my friend would live and work. 

From the first plot, we see that London is super rainy. In the last year  of the available data (2019), it has rained every month. In October 2019, it rained almost 90mm. Even in June, London's summer, it rained almost 80 mm. 


The second plot looks at cloud cover. It is never not cloudy in London. 


Thirdly, it is cold! In some months of the year, the average minimum temperature is below 0 degrees. 

```{r }
ggplot(data = london_weather, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = max_temp, color = "Max Temp"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = min_temp, color = "Min Temp"), size = 1) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Temperature (°C)") +
  ggtitle("Max and Min Temperature in London") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()


# min(london_weather$min_temp)
# summarise(london_weather$mean_temp)

# colnames(london_weather)

# class(london_weather$max_temp)
# mean(london_weather$max_temp, na.rm =TRUE)
london <- na.omit(london_weather)


# lon <- london %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2019-01-01")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = precipitation)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Date") +
#   ylab("Precipitation (mm)") +
#   ggtitle("Precipitation in London") +
#   theme_minimal()
# 
# lon


#total precipitation per month from 2019
london$date <- as.Date(london$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

london$month <- format(london$date, "%Y-%m")

london_filtered <- london[london$date >= as.Date("2019-01-01"), ]

monthly_precipitation <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(total_precipitation = sum(precipitation, na.rm = TRUE))

# ggplot(data = monthly_precipitation, aes(x = month, y = total_precipitation)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Total Precipitation (mm)") +
#   ggtitle("Total Monthly Precipitation in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
precip <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_precipitation, total_precipitation, " Total Precipitation")

precip


#cloud cover
london$date <- as.Date(london$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

london$month <- format(london$date, "%Y-%m")

london_filtered <- london[london$date >= as.Date("2019-01-01"), ]

monthly_cloudy <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(avg_cloud = mean(cloud_cover, na.rm = TRUE))




# ggplot(data = monthly_cloudy, aes(x = month, y = avg_cloud)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Average Cloudiness (1-10)") +
#   ggtitle("Average Monthly Cloudiness in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
cloud <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_cloudy, avg_cloud, "Average Cloudiness")
cloud 

#Even in summer it is super cloudy


monthly_min_temp <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(min_temp = min(min_temp, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the monthly minimum temperature
# ggplot(data = monthly_min_temp, aes(x = month, y = min_temp)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Minimum Temperature (Celcius)") +
#   ggtitle("Average Monthly Minimum Temp in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
cold <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_min_temp, min_temp, "Average Minimum Temp")
cold
```

I have also includede some tables for my friend to see how miserable the wather is in London.

```{r }
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Assuming your dataset is named "london" and the date column is named "date"

# Convert the date column to a Date format if it's not already in the correct format


london$year <- lubridate::year(london$date)

summary_stats <- london %>% filter(london$date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"), ) %>%  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    min_temp = min(min_temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_temp = max(max_temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_temp = mean(mean_temp, na.rm =TRUE)


  )


kable(summary_stats, caption = "Stats Table", align = "c") %>%
    kable_styling()
# 
# # Print the formatted table
# print(summary_stats)



# source("code/generate_summary_stats.R")
# summary_table <- generate_summary_stats(london, "2015-01-01")
# print(summary_table)
 
summary_stats_sun <- london %>% filter(london$date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"), ) %>%  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    sunshine_mean = mean(sunshine, na.rm = TRUE),
    cloud_cover_mean = mean (cloud_cover, na.rm = TRUE),
    precipitation_mean = max(precipitation, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

kable(summary_stats_sun, caption = "Stats Table", align = "c") %>%
    kable_styling()
# source("code/generate_summary_stats_extra.R")
# summary_table2 <- generate_summary_stats_extra(london, "2015-01-01")
# print(summary_table2)


```

# UK In General {-}

Even if my friend does not move to London, it is cold everywhere in the UK. I plotted the yearly average temperature in the UK. The average temperature does not rise above 10-11 degrees. Its been like this since 1880 - its not going to change anytime soon. 

Because it is so cold in the UK, there are days where heating is required (Heating days). From the figure, it can be seen that there are at minimum 220 days a year that require heating. January 2023 got off to a cold start, where everyday required heating (making the graph spike at the end). Regardless, There are sometimes over 300 days of the year which require heating.
