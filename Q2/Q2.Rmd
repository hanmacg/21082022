# Introduction {-}
 
I must convince my friend to stay in Cape Town and not move to London based on how awful the weather is there. We all know that Cape Town has the best climate which makes it so difficult to live anywhere else. 

# Data  {-}
I
have data on both London and the UK in general. I first examine London before assessing the overall weather in the UK.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r }
# This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

UK <- read_csv("data/UKMonthly_Detailed.csv")
london_weather <- read_csv("data/london_weather.csv")

london_weather$date <- as.character(london_weather$date)

london_weather$date <- as.Date(london_weather$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

UK$DATE <- as.Date(paste0(UK$DATE, "-01"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

# London {-}

Firstly, I examine data on London specifically, as this is likely where my friend would live and work. 

From the first plot, we see that London is super rainy. In the last year  of the available data (2019), it has rained every month. In October 2019, it rained almost 90mm. Even in June, London's summer, it rained almost 80 mm. This would not happen in Cape Town.

```{r }
ggplot(data = london_weather, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = max_temp, color = "Max Temp"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = min_temp, color = "Min Temp"), size = 1) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Temperature (Â°C)") +
  ggtitle("Max and Min Temperature in London") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()


# min(london_weather$min_temp)
# summarise(london_weather$mean_temp)

# colnames(london_weather)

# class(london_weather$max_temp)
# mean(london_weather$max_temp, na.rm =TRUE)
london <- na.omit(london_weather)


# lon <- london %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2019-01-01")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = precipitation)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Date") +
#   ylab("Precipitation (mm)") +
#   ggtitle("Precipitation in London") +
#   theme_minimal()
# 
# lon


#total precipitation per month from 2019
london$date <- as.Date(london$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

london$month <- format(london$date, "%Y-%m")

london_filtered <- london[london$date >= as.Date("2019-01-01"), ]

monthly_precipitation <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(total_precipitation = sum(precipitation, na.rm = TRUE))

# ggplot(data = monthly_precipitation, aes(x = month, y = total_precipitation)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Total Precipitation (mm)") +
#   ggtitle("Total Monthly Precipitation in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
precip <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_precipitation, total_precipitation, " Total Precipitation")

precip
```

The second plot looks at cloud cover. It is never not cloudy in London. How could you leave sunny South Africa?

```{r }
#cloud cover
london$date <- as.Date(london$date, format = "%Y%m%d")

london$month <- format(london$date, "%Y-%m")

london_filtered <- london[london$date >= as.Date("2019-01-01"), ]

monthly_cloudy <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(avg_cloud = mean(cloud_cover, na.rm = TRUE))


# ggplot(data = monthly_cloudy, aes(x = month, y = avg_cloud)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Average Cloudiness (1-10)") +
#   ggtitle("Average Monthly Cloudiness in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
cloud <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_cloudy, avg_cloud, "Average Cloudiness")
cloud 

#Even in summer it is super cloudy
```

Thirdly, it is cold! In some months of the year, the average minimum temperature is below 0 degrees. 


```{r }
monthly_min_temp <- london_filtered %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(min_temp = min(min_temp, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the monthly minimum temperature
# ggplot(data = monthly_min_temp, aes(x = month, y = min_temp)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
#   xlab("Month") +
#   ylab("Minimum Temperature (Celcius)") +
#   ggtitle("Average Monthly Minimum Temp in London (2019 onwards)") +
#   theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


source("code/plot_monthly_data.R")
cold <- plot_monthly_data(monthly_min_temp, min_temp, "Average Minimum Temp")
cold
```

I have also included some tables for my friend to see how miserable the weather is in London.

The average temperature is around 12 degrees Celsius each year. It can often be as cold as -5 degree Celsius. 


```{r }
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

#creating a year variable

london$year <- lubridate::year(london$date)

summary_stats <- london %>% filter(london$date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"), ) %>%  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    min_temp = min(min_temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_temp = max(max_temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_temp = mean(mean_temp, na.rm =TRUE)


  )

new_colnames <- c("Year", "Min Temp", "Max Temp", "Avg Temp")

colnames(summary_stats) <- new_colnames

kable(summary_stats, caption = "Temperature Range", align = "c") %>%
    kable_styling()

# print(summary_stats)



# source("code/generate_summary_stats.R")
# summary_table <- generate_summary_stats(london, "2015-01-01")
# print(summary_table)
```

Again, the average rain is substantial and even though there is some sunshine, on average, it is matched by lots of cloudiness. 

```{r }
summary_stats_sun <- london %>% filter(london$date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"), ) %>%  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    sunshine_mean = mean(sunshine, na.rm = TRUE),
    cloud_cover_mean = mean (cloud_cover, na.rm = TRUE),
    precipitation_mean = max(precipitation, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
new_colnamess <- c("Year", "Average Sun", "Average Cloudiness", "Average Rain")

colnames(summary_stats_sun) <- new_colnamess

kable(summary_stats_sun, caption = "Sunshine, Cloudiness and Rain", align = "c") %>%
    kable_styling()
# source("code/generate_summary_stats_extra.R")
# summary_table2 <- generate_summary_stats_extra(london, "2015-01-01")
# print(summary_table2)


```

# UK {-}

Even if my friend does not move to London, it is cold everywhere in the UK. I plotted the yearly average temperature in the UK. The average temperature does not rise above 10-11 degrees. It has been like this since 1880 - its not going to change anytime soon. 

```{r}


#make data yearly - as you can see average temperatures since 1880 are very low. On Average, the temperature is below 11 degrees Celsius. 

UK_yearly_temp <- UK %>%
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(DATE)) %>%
  summarize(average_temperature = mean(TAVG, na.rm = TRUE))

# ggplot(data = UK_yearly, aes(x = year, y = average_temperature)) +
#   geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
#   xlab("Year") +
#   ylab("Average Temperature") +
#   ggtitle("Yearly Average Temperature in UK") +
#   theme_minimal()


source("code/plot_yearly_data.R")
temp <- plot_yearly_data(UK_yearly_temp, average_temperature, "Average Temperature", "Yearly Average Temperature in UK")
temp
```

Because it is so cold in the UK, there are days where heating is required (Heating days). From the figure, it can be seen that there are at minimum 220 days a year that require heating. January 2023 got off to a cold start, where everyday required heating (making the graph spike at the end). Regardless, there are sometimes over 300 days of the year which require heating.

```{r}
UK_yearly_heat <- UK %>%
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(DATE)) %>% summarize(average_heat = mean(HTDD, na.rm = TRUE))

# ggplot(data = UK_yearly, aes(x = year, y = average_heat)) +
#   geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
#   xlab("Year") +
#   ylab("Average Number of Heating Days") +
#   ggtitle("Yearly Average Number of Heating Days in UK") +
#   theme_minimal()

heat <- plot_yearly_data(UK_yearly_temp, average_temperature, "Average Number of Heating Days", "Yearly Average Number of Heating Days in UK")
heat

```


# Conclusion {-}

The UK is a terrible place to move to if one dislikes the cold, lack of sunshine, and rain.
