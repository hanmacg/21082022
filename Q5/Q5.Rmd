# Introduction {-}

The report gives insights into App designs for the development of a great new app.

# Data  {-}

...

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r }

  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

#  Methodology \label{Meth} {-}

## Subsection {-}
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]



<!-- $$ -->
<!-- This is a commented out section in the writing part. -->
<!-- Comments are created by highlighting text, amnd pressing CTL+C -->
<!-- \\begin{align} -->
<!-- \\beta = \\alpha^2 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!-- $$ -->

## Results {-}


```{r table-1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
